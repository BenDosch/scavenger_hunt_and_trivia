## The Hunt for Broken Arrow

### Introduction
[The Hunt for Broken Arrow](https://bendoschgit.github.io/scavenger_hunt_and_trivia/) was designed for The Museum Broken Arrow to be used in place of worksheets that they currently provide to guests. This application is currently designed for use on Android devices. Users are able to answer questions about exhibits at the museum through a free form text box, and Administrators are able to update, remove, and add questions through the administrative panel.
