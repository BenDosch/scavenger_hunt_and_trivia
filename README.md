## The Hunt for Broken Arrow

### Introduction
[The Hunt for Broken Arrow](https://bendoschgit.github.io/scavenger_hunt_and_trivia/) was designed for The Museum Broken Arrow to be used in place of worksheets that they currently provide to guests. This application is currently designed for use on Android devices. Users are able to answer questions about exhibits at the museum through a free form text box, and Administrators are able to update, remove, and add questions through the administrative panel.

### Usage
![Trivia Page](/images/trivia.png)
Users can enter answers to questions using a text box, and store their answers. This data is not saved permanently, and only intended to be stored during the user's visit to the museum.

![Admin](/images/adminlogin.png)
For security purposes, the admin features are placed behind a password. When the correct password is entered, the user is then able to access the admin panel.

If the incorrect password is entered, the user will need to re-enter the password to gain access.

In later versions, the application will also have a scavenger hunt. On this screen, users will be able to select either the Trivia or Scavenger Hunt to modify.
